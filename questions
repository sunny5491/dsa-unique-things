in this question we have to recursively remove adjacent similar words. we have to remember in step s[i]==s[i+1] wwe increment i to i+1 but in while loop i again increments so that letter is no more in new
string. here is the code:
#User function Template for python3

class Solution:
    def removeUtil (self, S):
        def remove_adjacent_duplicates(s):
            if not s:
                return s  
        
            n = len(s)
            i = 0
            new_s = ""
        
            while i < n:
                if i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                    while i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                        i += 1  
                else:
                    new_s += s[i]  
        
                i += 1  
        
            return s if new_s == s else remove_adjacent_duplicates(new_s)
        return remove_adjacent_duplicates(S)

2:https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/     in this question we have to reach to the end ie beyond last index so we take to two 
elements a,b for last element and for beyond last element. then we iterate and change b to a and a to temp:
code : class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        a, b = cost[-1], 0


        for n in range(len(cost) - 2, -1, -1):
            temp = min(a + cost[n], b + cost[n])
            b = a
            a = temp
        
        return min(a, b)
