in this question we have to recursively remove adjacent similar words. we have to remember in step s[i]==s[i+1] wwe increment i to i+1 but in while loop i again increments so that letter is no more in new
string. here is the code:
#User function Template for python3

class Solution:
    def removeUtil (self, S):
        def remove_adjacent_duplicates(s):
            if not s:
                return s  
        
            n = len(s)
            i = 0
            new_s = ""
        
            while i < n:
                if i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                    while i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                        i += 1  
                else:
                    new_s += s[i]  
        
                i += 1  
        
            return s if new_s == s else remove_adjacent_duplicates(new_s)
        return remove_adjacent_duplicates(S)
